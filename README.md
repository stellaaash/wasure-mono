# A single-threaded CPU Renderer

The goal of this project is to learn computer graphics and the Zig programming language
using the [Computer Graphics from Scratch]() book by Gabriel Gambetta.

## Usage
```bash
zig run main.zig
```

Then open the newly created `out.ppt` file.
Everything is hard-coded for now, eventually I plan to make it possible to change the scene easily through a dedicated scene file.
